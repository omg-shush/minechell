## Features
- Sit: Right-click on a chair to take a seat!
    - Must use empty hand on the top-facing part of a block
    - A chair is a bottom slab or bottom stair with at least one adjacent sign or trapdoor
    - A chair must have a solid block (that you could stand on) underneath, and a non-opaque block above.
    - 1-second cooldown on sitting in a chair
- Hat: Put any item on your head!
    - Use /hat while holding the item in your main hand
    - If you're already wearing something on your head, it'll be swapped with your hand
- Invisible ItemFrames: Use a phantom membrane to hide an item frame!
    - The ItemFrame must be filled for this to work
    - Use an ink sac to make it visible again

    - When you remove the item, the invisible ItemFrame will break off
